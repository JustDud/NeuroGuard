### ⚠️ Problem in the Year 2080

Welcome to 2080. Cities pulse with code. Brain implants stream ads into your dreams. You're connected, enhanced, optimised—until you're not.

In this hyper-digital world, attention isn’t just valuable—it’s under siege. Constant sensory input, AI-driven life assistance, immersive neural feeds—over time, it all builds up. The human brain, once adapted for silence, now drowns in data. The result?  
**Mental fragmentation. Cognitive crashes. Synthetic psychosis.**

While cybernetics evolve, mental health decays. We don’t need more stimulation—we need a **shield**.

### 🛡️ Our Solution: NeuroGuard

**NeuroGuard** is an AI-powered mental state monitoring system designed to defend users from digital overload and emotional burnout in ultra-connected environments.

Built with machine learning and a sleek web interface, NeuroGuard collects key lifestyle signals and outputs a **mental state score** (0–100). Based on that score, it can activate **Gemini AI**-driven interventions and suggest lifestyle tweaks to restore cognitive balance.
